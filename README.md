# serverlessbox

serverlessbox is a file storage application using Amazon S3.

## Description

The motivation for this project is to build low cost, high-capacity shared storage. Most of the best storage services have limited storage space on their free plans. And it's just a little pricey for paid plans.

serverlessbox is a storage service that you can start with Amazon S3 usage fee (low cost!).
By building the application within your AWS account, storage charges are tied to your AWS charges.
